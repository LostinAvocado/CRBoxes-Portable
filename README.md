### 3D Printing STL files

I had these printed at a local library. You might check there, or with a local community college, university, or high school if you don't have access to a 3D printer otherwise, and sometimes there are local maker groups. 

There are 6 files, choose the one that matches the combination of filter and PC fan you want to use, you may need to use a rubber band or duct tape to get a tight fit (since I left some room so the adapter would definitely fit the filter). 

### HEPA filters:

The below filters are ones that are OEM and that I felt would be most likely to be "geniune" HEPA as stated.
